Welcome to the project repository! This repository showcases a web server project implemented in Go. The primary objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of Go and gain hands-on experience with backend development principles. The repository serves as a learning resource to demonstrate my progress in backend development and highlight my commitment to expanding my skillset.

## Introduction
As a developer with a strong background in frontend technologies, I have embarked on a journey to broaden my expertise in backend development. This repository represents my exploration of backend concepts using Go, where I gradually incorporate various features and architectural aspects as I delve deeper into the language.

By sharing this project, my intention is to present my dedication to continuous learning and self-improvement. While I may not have extensive commercial experience in backend development, this repository serves as evidence of my proactive approach to acquiring knowledge in this field.

## Features Explored
Throughout the project, I have focused on implementing different features and exploring various aspects of backend development. Some of the key areas covered in this project include:

+ Routing and request handling
+ Database integration
+ Error handling and logging


Feel free to explore the codebase and commit history to gain insights into the gradual development of these features and my growing familiarity with backend development principles
